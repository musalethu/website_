# INTRODUCTION

JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

# BODY

What is an Array?
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

var car1 = "Saab";
var car2 = "Volvo";
var car3 = "BMW";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

# SOLUTION

var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

# CONCLUSION

Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.
